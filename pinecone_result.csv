When a molecule is brought in contact with a metallic electrode, the molecular orbitals and the electrode states overlap to a certain extent to form a new hybrid electronic wavefunction. The degree of coupling may vary from conjugated states extending over the whole molecular junction, to the generation of orbital nodes along the junction acting as barriers to electronic transport between the elect rodes. Despite the great progress made in this field, and the apparent simplicity of the sandwich style molecular junction (Figure 2), a full theoretical description of metal|molecule|metal junctions and a detailed understanding of structure -property relationships, remain a s challenge s.

IntroductionA  molecule  junction,  where  a  single  or  a  small  number  ofmolecules  bridge  metal  electrodes,  is  a  key  component  of  molecularelectronic  devices  [1,2] .  The  diode  [3,4] ,  switch  [5,  memory  [8],and  transistor  [9]  properties  have  been  reported  for  the  moleculejunctions.  Unconventional  functionalities  and  properties  have  beenalso  reported  for  the  molecule  junction  owing  to  their  uniquestructure  [10,11] . The  molecule  junction  is  a  one  dimensionalnano  material  with  two  metalecule  interfaces.  However,  poorreproducibility  of  the  experimental  results  limits  the  practicalapplication  of  the  molecule  junctions  to  electronic  devices.  Oneof  the  reasons  for  poor  reproducibility  is  lack  of  the  informa-tion  about  the  atomic  structure  of  the  molecule  junction.  In  mostof  previous  studies,  only  electronic  conductance  of  the  moleculejunction  has  been  discussed  without  characterizing  the  structureresponding author.E-mail address:  kiguti@chem.titech.ac.jp  (M.  Kiguchi).of the molecule junction.  It  is  not  clear  how  a  target  moleculeactually  bridges gap  between  metal  electrodes,  and  the  molecu-lar  conformation  and  the  metalecule  interface  structure  inthe  molecule  junction  is  not  clear.  The  vibration  spectroscopy  isthe  most  promising  technique  to  characterize  the  molecule  junc-tion,  and  inelastic  electron  tunneling  spectroscopy  (IETS)  has  beenapplied  to  a  number  of  molecule  junctions,  including  hydrogen,benzene,  benzenedithiol,  alkanedithiol,  and  so  on  [12 .  The  IETScan  con the  bridging  of  the  target  molecule  and  the  structureof  the  molecule  junction  has  been  well  characterized.  However,there is a  weak  point  in  the  IETS.  The  IETS  can  be  measured  only  atlow  temperature  (K).  The  vibration  spectroscopy  which  can  beapplied  at  room  temperature  is  strongly  required  to  characterizethe  molecule  junction  operating  at  room  temperature.  The  sur-face  enhanced  Raman  scattering  (SERS)  is  an  appropriate  vibrationspectroscopy  to  characterize  the  molecule  junction  at  room  tem-perature  [16 .  In  the  molecule  junction,  molecules  are  trappedin  the  nano  gap  [19 .  The  enhanced    is  formed  in  the  nanogap.  The SERS signal  from  the  molecule  in  the  gap  is  selectivelyenhanced.  The  sensitivity  of  SERS  is  also  important  to  study  thehttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2018.10.0082352-9407/18  Elsevier  Ltd.  All  rights  reserved.'"
