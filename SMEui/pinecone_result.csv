The spatial orientation and electronic coupling between each component profoundly affect the conductance properties and functions of the single-molecule device. We describe the design principles of the anchor group, the influence of the electronic configuration of the electrode and the effect of manipulating the structure of the molecular backbone and of its substituent groups.

"b'7 ChallengesThe  sometimes called molecular electronics actually should extend wellbeyond simple measurement of current/voltage characteristics of single molecules.The latter topic, single molecule transport, has comprised by far the dominantreported molecular electronics measurement and modeling, and, as has beendiscussed above, the community is reaching some agreement in this area.The original vision of molecular electronics was not only single transport, butactual applications of that single molecule transport, and more complicatedmechanisms, towards electronic phenomena (and perhaps electronic devices)based on the functional use of molecules [ 110,111]. In its most visionary manifes-tation, these would be single molecules; there have been a number of importantefforts in the single-molecule device area that extend beyond simple transport[112]. Issues such as decoherence and fabrication complexity have plaguedthis area, but it remains as an important intellectual challenge. The original idea ofmolecular rectiion has been experimentally established in important, extensivework by Metzger and colleagues [ 117,118].Since the notion of single molecule devices was put forward in the 1970s, the of electronics has moved on in a very elegant (and prole) fashion. Severalareas have been developed, areas in which molecules might well provideadvantages. We will complete this overview with a very brief description of someof these situations.In this chapter, we will deal with the challenges involved in single moleculeelectronics, or possibly the electronics of systems with a few molecules. This is tobe distinguished from multimolecule effects in electronics, where a good deal ofprogress has been made. Organic electronics [ 119] now comprises an entire , asdoes organic optoelectronics [ 120]. In these areas, molecules act as functionaldevices, but not on a single molecule basis. Areas such as organic photovoltaics,organic transistors, and organic light emitting diodes are already the stuff ofcommerce, and represent challenging s for the chemical sciences and thematerials and electronic engineering s.Sometimes molecules are used as layers in other devices. For example,molecules can act as capacitors, and this relatively new  is promising forapplications in energy storage as well as providing typical capacitance behaviorin thin devices [ 121,122].SAMs containing molecules (originally based on thiol/gold interactions, but nowextended to many different molecular terminal groups and multiple solids includingmetals, semiconductors, and some insulators) represent another signit area ofapplication. One obvious application is the control of the afy and ionizationpotentials of a given macroscopic material that can be provided by dipolar layers ofSAMs on their surfaces [ 123,124]. One can also make mixed SAMs, in particularSAMs of molecules that should be pretty good insulators (such as alkane thiols) andunsaturated molecules that should be good transporters [ 125,126]. Many groupshave examined statistics, sometimes asking about whether the current throughMolecular Electronic Junction Transport: Some Pathways and Some Ideas 25'"
